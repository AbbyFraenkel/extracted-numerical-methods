## Implementation Details

### 1. Space-Time OCFE Discretization

#### Basis Function Selection
- Spatial domain: Legendre or Lagrange polynomials
- Temporal domain: Typically Lagrange polynomials
- Key considerations:
  * Order impacts accuracy and conditioning
  * Tensor-product basis simplifies implementation
  * Adaptive order selection can optimize performance

#### Collocation Point Selection
- Gauss points for interior collocation
- Gauss-Lobatto points when including element boundaries
- Placement strategies:
  * Uniform: Simplest but less accurate
  * Chebyshev: Better for handling endpoint singularities
  * Gauss-Legendre: Optimal for polynomial interpolation
  * Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre: Includes endpoints naturally

#### Matrix Assembly Approach
- Element-by-element assembly
- Sparse matrix storage format
- Global numbering scheme accounting for continuity
- Efficient implementation:
  * Precompute basis function evaluations
  * Use structured sparsity patterns
  * Implement matrix-free operations where possible

#### Boundary and Initial Condition Implementation
- Strong enforcement (direct substitution)
- Weak enforcement (penalization or Lagrange multipliers)
- Mixed approaches for different types of conditions
- Implementation considerations:
  * Consistent with discretization accuracy
  * Preserves well-posedness of the system
  * Maintains sparsity pattern where possible

### 2. Quasi-Sequential Algorithm Implementation

#### Initialization Strategies
- Zero control or initial guess
- Solution of simplified problem
- Continuation from coarser discretization
- Important considerations:
  * Impact on convergence speed
  * Avoiding poor local minima
  * Computational overhead

#### PDE Solver Selection
- Direct solvers for smaller problems (UMFPACK, MUMPS)
- Iterative solvers for larger problems (GMRES, BiCGStab)
- Preconditioned approaches for ill-conditioned systems
- Performance characteristics:
  * Memory requirements scale with problem size
  * Direct solvers: O(N^1.5) - O(N^2) complexity
  * Iterative solvers: O(N log N) with good preconditioners

#### Optimization Subproblem Solvers
- Limited-memory BFGS for large-scale problems
- Sequential Quadratic Programming for constrained problems
- Trust-region methods for improved globalization
- Implementation considerations:
  * Warm-starting between iterations
  * Approximate Hessian updates
  * Handling of constraints

#### Line Search Implementation
- Backtracking Armijo line search
- More sophisticated approaches (Wolfe conditions)
- Adaptive step size selection
- Important parameters:
  * Initial step length (typically 1.0)
  * Sufficient decrease parameter (0.1-0.001)
  * Step reduction factor (0.5-0.8)

#### Convergence Criteria
- Gradient norm below tolerance
- Relative change in objective below tolerance
- Maximum iteration count
- Implementation details:
  * Scale-invariant criteria where possible
  * Combined criteria for robustness
  * Problem-dependent tolerance selection

### 3. Adjoint Solver Implementation

#### PDE Linearization
- Analytical derivatives when available
- Automatic differentiation approaches
- Numerical differentiation as fallback
